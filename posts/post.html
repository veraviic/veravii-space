            Typing as memory — sound as persistence across time.

        <p>
          The rhythm of keys persists — mechanical sound tracing time’s pulse. I
          no longer remember when I stopped using it, but the gestures linger,
          carried through newer devices, transferred like inheritance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Machines are small witnesses. Each click holds a memory, a method, a
          continuation of motion — reminders that our interfaces remember us as
          much as we remember them.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          What if archiving isn’t a backward glance, but a forward vibration?
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          To archive is to project — to imagine continuity. When I touch the
          worn-out keys again, it’s not to relive a moment but to see how that
          motion continues, differently, elsewhere.
